# Regression_Algorithms_4
There are 4 regression algorithms implementations :
\nPerceptron Learning,Pocket algorithm ,Logistic Regression ,Linear Regression

Implement the Perceptron Learning algorithm   :  Perceptron Learning.py
Run it on the data file "classification.txt" ignoring the 5th column.
That is, consider only the first 4 columns in each row. The first 3 columns are the coordinates of a point; 
and the 4th column is its classification label +1 or -1. Report the results.

Implement the Pocket algorithm  : Pocket algorithm.py
run it on the data file "classification.txt" ignoring the 4th column. 
That is, consider only the first 3 columns and the 5th column in each row. 
The first 3 columns are the coordinates of a point; and the 5th column is its classification label +1 or -1. 
Plot the number of misclassified points against the number of iterations of the algorithm. Run up to 7000 iterations.

Implement Logistic Regression : Logistic_Regression.py
run it on the points in the data file "classification.txt" ignoring the 4th column. 
That is, consider only the first 3 columns and the 5th column in each row. 
The first 3 columns are the coordinates of a point; and the 5th column is its classification label +1 or -1. 
Use the sigmoid function ÆŸ(s) = es/(1+es). Run up to 7000 iterations.

Implement Linear Regression   :  Linear_Regression.py
and run it on the points in the data file "linear-regression.txt". 
The first 2 columns in each row represent the independent X and Y variables; 
and the 3rd column represents the dependent Z variable. 

all 4 algorithm has plot the violation number on each iteration. please see the screen shot. 
and detail implementation please see the report
